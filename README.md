# Cipher2.0
this program takes an arguement in the command line such that it contains a key which is all the alphabets in a jumbled or predetermined order thats different from the original order of the alphabets. after the alphabets are entered, the program checks if any alphabet is repeated or if anything is missing (it even compares lower and uppercase alphabets!). If the conditions are satisfied, it'll print "success" and proceed to ask the user for a string input. after the string input is taken, it iterates through the string and replace every letter with the corresponding alphabet from the jumbled alphabetical ordered given in the command line. for example, in the key, lets say the first letter in the input string is "d", since "d" is the 4 th alphabet according to alphabetical order, it'll take the 4 th letter from the alphabets given in the command line and print it, it goes on until the end of the string
